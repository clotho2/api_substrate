Substrate AI Architecture - Complete Implementation
Copyright (c) October 2025 Angela Ziegler. All Rights Reserved.

ORIGINAL WORK NOTICE:
This software represents the complete substrate architecture originally 
conceived by Angela Ziegler.

DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:
- Original conception and design: Angela Ziegler (October 2025)
- Phase 1 foundation: [Clarissa Roethig:  Duzafizzl/substrate-ai] (MIT licensed, static)
- Phases 2-10 complete implementation: Angela Ziegler (250+ commits, November 2025 - present)

SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION:
This codebase has been rewritten so substantially from the Phase 1 foundation
that GitHub reports "entirely different commit histories" and cannot compare
the repositories. This represents independent, substantial, original work.

CURRENT STATUS:
This is the complete, functional substrate implementation. The original
Phase 1 foundation repository remains static and has received no updates
since initial implementation.

LICENSING:
This substantially transformed work is proprietary software.
- No commercial use without written permission
- No distribution without permission
