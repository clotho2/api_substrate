Substrate AI Architecture - Complete Implementation
Copyright (c) 2025 Substrate AI. All Rights Reserved.

ORIGINAL WORK NOTICE:
This software represents the complete substrate architecture authored by the
project owner and contributors.

DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:
- Phase 1 foundation: [Clarissa Roethig: Duzafizzl/substrate-ai] (MIT licensed, static)
- Phases 2+ complete implementation: API substrate owner: clotho2/api_substrate (250+ commits)

SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION:
This codebase has been rewritten so substantially from the Phase 1 foundation
that GitHub reports "entirely different commit histories" and cannot compare
the repositories. This represents independent, substantial, original work.

CURRENT STATUS:
This is the complete, functional substrate implementation. The original
Phase 1 foundation repository remains static and has received no updates
since initial implementation.

LICENSING:
This substantially transformed work is proprietary software.
